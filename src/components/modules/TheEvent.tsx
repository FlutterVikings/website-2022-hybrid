            we might postpone the in-person conference. We strongly advise you to book
            your trip with the flexibility that you can change in an emergency. We will

              Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the rise of Omicron variation and
              its global implications, we believe the in-person conference in February
              2022 won't introduce the best experience anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, to ensure that we will bring you the best and top-notch Flutter
              conference experience in the world, We have changed our program to match the
              current situation as follow:
            </p>
            <h3>Online only (2-3 February 2022)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Conference will happen entirely online on the{' '}
                <b>2nd and 3rd of February 2022</b>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The new program will be announced on our website soon to match
                online-edition.
              </li>
              <li>
                We are working hard to have a new format for our online edition that is
                top-notch and unique to convey the best online-conf experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have an existing ticket it has been transferred to the in-person
                event later this year. If you want to attend the online-only event in
                February you must book a FREE ticket at

                participate in the activities and win our prizes if you have a valid
                ticket!

            <h3>Hybrid, in-person & Online (31st August, 1st September 2022)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We are postponing the in-person Conference to
                <b>31st August and 1st September 2022</b>
              </li>
              <li>We will open our CFP once more for new dates in April 2022. </li>
              <li>The venue and location will remain the same.</li>
              <li>
                Your conference registration will be transferred to the new conference
                dates.
              </li>
              <li>
                We highly recommend you keep your ticket as we have almost sold out. We
                believe the new date will accelerate ticket sales even faster. If you
                still want to join our Conference, it's best not to risk it now.
              </li>
              <li>
